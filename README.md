### Developed with Nuxtjs / Vue.js and D3js for charts 

You would need to run:

`npm install`

Which will install tailwindcss and nuxtjs

Then you should be able to run

`npm run dev`

And that will compile the code, run a server and give you a link to the page. It should work with hot-reloading, but if you create folders you will need to stop and restart it.
